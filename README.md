# md2confluence
Update confluence pages from your markdown files (like a README.md)

## HowTo use it

### Install the package


You can safely install it as a global package:

```bash
npm install -g md2confluence
```
This will allow you to use the command ```md2confluence``` anywhere.

But, it's intended to development environments and I recommend to install it as dev dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev md2confluence
```

...and excecuting it as a npm script.


### Create the .md2confluence-rc file

It's mandatory. It looks like:
```javascript
{
  "baseUrl": "https://my.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api",
  "user": "my-user (Optional)",
  "pass": "my-password (Optional)",
  "pages": [
    {
      "pageid": "37748761",
      "mdfile": "README.md",
      "title": "Optional title in the confluence page"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

__baseUrl__:
it's the atlassian API url of confluence.

__user__ (OPTIONAL):
Your confluence username. If you don't set any it will be prompt it.

__pass__ (OPTIONAL):
Your confluence password. If you don't set any it will be prompt it.

__pages__:
A list of objects with the pages do you want to Update.

__pages[*].pageid__:
The page ID of confluence.
You can see it as a URL Param when you edit your page in confluence.

__pages[*].mdfile__:
The path to the file in Markdown format with the content to update the page.
It's relative to the dir where you run the command.

__pages[*].mdfile__ (OPTIONAL):
The path to the file in Markdown format with the content to update the page.
It's relative to the dir where you run the command.


### Use Environmental Variables to store username and password

If you wish to not use the config file to store your username and password, you may also use your Environmental Variables to do so. The name of the environmental variables must be as below:

```
Username = $MD2CUSER
Password = $MD2CPASS
```


### Excecute as a node app

You can use the command in the working directory (if it was installed globally):

```bash
md2confluence
```

Or exceute it from your node_modules in your working directory (installed locally):

```bash
node_modules/.bin/md2confluence
```

Or you can add this like a npm script in your package.json (recommended if it was installed as devDependencies):

```javascript
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "pushdoc": "md2confluence"
  },
  ...
}
```
